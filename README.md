# Triton Voltage

Triton Voltage starts a flask server that reads serial data from an arduino representing the voltages of three cells in a lithium ion battery.

To build the circuit, you need the following materials:
    1. One Lithium Ion Battery, with 4 pins - three voltage pins, 1 ground. Currently the circuit is designed for a 12v LIPO.
    2. One Jetson Nano
    3. One Teensy v3.2
    4. Male to Female and Female to Female Wires
    5. Wire Cutters
