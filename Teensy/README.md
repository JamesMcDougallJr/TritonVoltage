# ECE/MAE 148 Battery Monitor
 
This is an Arduino script for the final project of the course ECE 148 - Intro to Autonomous Vehicles.

It reads from a Teensy microcontroller on the rising edge of the clock three voltages, 4,8,12 being the max readings.

The .hex file is generated by using the Arduino IDE. Therefore, updates to the .ino file require you to re-generate the .hex file by doing the following:
    1. Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE
    2.
